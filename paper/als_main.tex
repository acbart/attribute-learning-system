	%The Computer Science Education community has an established interest in skills \cite{bayliss:csgames}.
    
	
	\subsection{More details}

    Blahdyblah

\begin{itemize}
	\item This is a list
	\item And there's even some \textbf{bold text} in this list.
	\item that's enough listing.
\end{itemize}

    Pancakes.
	
\section{Solution}

\subsection{Prior Work}

Need to edit this
	
\subsection{Target Audience}

%\begin{listings}
%Listings are pretty cool. It's how you embed code. But I forgot to include the package.

% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{sigproc}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references

\begin{thebibliography}{1}

% Bibliography goes here

\end{thebibliography}

%Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
%then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
%to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
%the .tex source file and comment out
%the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
