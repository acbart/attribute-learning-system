Evaluation measure

Pick a fitness function and stick with it
    Or two, probably not more

Absolutely should try:
    Evaluate the different results
    
Human trial
    With best results
    Flip a coin to decide which players get which fitness functions
    Try 5 of one fitness function, 5 of the other, to play 10 games using a movelist and then see how they evalute
